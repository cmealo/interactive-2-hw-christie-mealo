While attending a data conference in October, I was introduced to CartoDB via a talk by the platform’s founder. Being that I love data and work for a travel agency I immediately became interested in the technology. First I experimented with some data pulled from my company’s database records, an example which I have omitted here. After my initial experiment I wanted to try more custom styling with CartoJS; this time focusing on sexual assault, a social issue for which I am more actively involved in generating awareness.
